class Focus:
    r"""
    A type of focus for a tau-vector.

    The possible values are:

    * ``Focus.DIRECT`` (:math:`\mu_1 > \mu_2 > \mu_3`),
    * ``Focus.FORWARD_FOCUSED`` (:math:`\mu_1 > \mu_2 = \mu_3`),
    * ``Focus.BACKWARD_FOCUSED`` (:math:`\mu_1 = \mu_2 > \mu_3`),
    * ``Focus.UNFOCUSED`` (:math:`\mu_1 = \mu_2 = \mu_3`).
